Random Number Gods
==================

The Random Number Gods provides various random numbers to worthy supplicants.
The pantheon of the Random Number Gods is strong, and flexible, and readily
accepts new deities into it's ranks.

The most revered and ancient books of the rngods is known as 'RNGOD 0.4'.

Using the Random Number Gods
============================

Known Gods
==========

The LCG
-------

The LCG is a simple god, great for supplicants after speed who do not mind
certain simplicities.  In ages past the LCG was known as Linear congruential
generator, but most just know him by his shorter name in modern times.

The true name of the LCG is best written as:
```c
x = seed * A + C
```

It is said the true names for the A and C, are 1664525 & 1013904223, deriving
from the ancient scriptures _Numerical Receipes in C_.

The Dethread Deity
------------------

The scriptures are clear, in that many of the other the Random Number Gods do
handle the cries of a thousand supplicants all crying out at once.
Unfortunately many of the believers require their deities to answer calls from
different parts of the great tapestry of life (sometimes called _threads_ in
other scriptures).

The dethread deity however can handle all, and will take care to deliver the
messages to and from another deity safely.  With the dethread deity relaying
your prayers, you can be safe in the knowledge that the message will get there
and back safely.  Never a Miscommunication.

The Constant God
----------------

There are those who wish to trial their deity, and demand that those they
(supposedly) venerate are unwavering in their gifts.  Those that do will find
the Constant god a great benefit.

The constant god can be created in either a true (7) form, or alternatively
created in the version of your choice.

The God of Sequences
--------------------

An unusual deity, best know for his love of sequences.  Once a prayer has been
sent to the god of sequences, he will send it back to the supplicant.  In some
cases, he will continue to repeat the sequence once the scriptures are
complete, in other cases, he is know to repeat the last item.
